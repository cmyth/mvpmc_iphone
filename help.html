<h1>mvpmc Help</h1>

<h2>Theory of Operation</h2>

<p>
The iphone is capable of playing low bandwith MPEG-4 and H.264
videos.  This will probably require you to transcode your MythTV
recordings.  If your original recordings are playable on the iphone
then you can ignore the VLC and web server settings.
</p>

<p>
mvpmc will allow you to initiate the transcoding of your MythTV
recordings via VLC.  It will then allow you to play them via a web
server.  Unfourtunately, the transcoding must complete before the
recording will be watchable.  Depending on your resources, this could
take a very long time.
</p>

<h2>MythTV Setup</h2>

<p>
You need to provide the IP address or hostname of your master MythTV
backend.  You may also specify the port, if you are using a
non-standard port number.
</p>

<h2>VLC Setup</h2>

<p>
In order to initiate transcoding, you will need to provide the IP
address or hostname where VLC is running.  You also need to provide
the pathname where the MythTV recordings are as well as the pathname
where the transcoded files should be stored.
</p>

<p>
You will need to make sure that VLC is running with the telnet
interface.  This can be done by starting it with the <i>vlc -I
telnet</i> command.
</p>

<h2>Web Server Setup</h2>

<p>
In order to watch transcoded recordings, you will need to provide the
base URL for the web server that will serve the files.  The URL should
be include the protocol, port number (if required), and path, such as
<i>http://192.168.1.1/mnt/mythtv/</i>.
</p>

<p>
The VLC transcoding will be done by appending <i>.mp4</i> to the name
of the recording and storing it in the VLC output path.  If you wish
to do this outside of mvpmc so that your recordings are always
playable on the iphone, then make sure they have the same filename as
mvpmc will expect.
</p>

<h2>Extra Information</h2>

<p>
The MythTV backend, VLC server, and web server can be on three
seperate systems.  If this is the case, you need to make sure that the
VLC server has access to the original recordings, and that the web
server has access to the transcoded recordings.
